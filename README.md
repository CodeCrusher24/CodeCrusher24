## Hi there 👋

I'm a 3rd year B.Tech CSE student with a strong interest in backend development.

Currently focusing on:
- Java, Spring & Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL and MySQL
- SQL problem-solving (LeetCode)

I enjoy building systems and learning fundamentals deeply rather than rushing through tutorials.
Right now, my goal is to strengthen my backend foundations, build solid projects, and move towards an internship.
